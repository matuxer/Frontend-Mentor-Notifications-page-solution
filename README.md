# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page solution

This is a solution to the  [Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This project is a notifications page that is designed to be responsive. It was created as a challenge from Frontend Mentor to practice and improve my skills using React, Redux Toolkit, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The main focus of this project was to practice using Tailwind CSS and React.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- HTML
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS

### Deployment

The project is deployed at https://notifications-page-gamma-inky.vercel.app using Vercel.

### Credits

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) for providing the design inspiration and challenge.
